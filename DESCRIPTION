Description: Feature rankings can be distorted by a single case in the
    context of high-dimensional data. The cases exerts abnormal influence
    on feature rankings are called influential points (IPs). The package
    aims at detecting IPs based on case deletion and quantifies their
    effects by measuring the rank changes (DOI:10.48550/arXiv.2303.10516).
    The package applies a novel rank comparing measure using the adaptive
    weights that stress the top-ranked important features and adjust the
    weights to ranking properties.
